#### About
This is a web application implementing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) system for simple Service Order Management.

---

#### Features
- REST API developed using the **Spring Boot Framework 4.22.0**.
- Deployment of the REST API to the cloud via the Heroku platform. (Note: Heroku was used initially but is no longer free.)
- Implements **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.
- Utilizes **Spring MVC** to structure and manage the HTTP requests and responses.
- Integrates **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.
- Employs **Spring Data JPA** to manage data persistence and interact with the MySQL database.
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure token-based authentication.
- Implements authentication and authorization.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

#### Customers
##### POST - CPF Validation
- Validates CPF according to Brazilian rules.
- Checks if the CPF already exists to avoid duplicating a customer.
- Validates email format and ensures it doesn't already exist in the database.

##### PUT - CPF Validation
- Checks for existing CPF during updates. If attempting to change to an already registered CPF, it returns an error.
- Validates email and ensures it isn't duplicated when updating a customer.

##### DELETE - Customer Deletion
- If a customer has any **Tickets**, deletion is not allowed.

---
#### Technicians

##### PUT - CPF Validation
- Validates the CPF according to Brazilian rules.
- Checks if the CPF already exists in the database to avoid duplicating a Technicians.
- Checks if the e-mail already exists in the database to avoid duplication a Technicians.

##### POST - Seller Update
- Receives the ID as a parameter and the body contains the information to be updated.
- If an invalid or already registered CPF is provided, the system informs that the CPF cannot be changed.
- If an invalid or already registered e-mail is provided, the system informs that the email cannot be changed.

##### DELETE - Seller Deletion
- Checks if the seller has any **Purchase Orders (PO)** linked to their ID. If they do, deletion is not allowed.

---

#### üìÑ Ticket
##### POST - Additional Information:
- Uses an **enum** type for priority and status.
- Links seller and customer by their IDs through related tables.

##### PUT - Update PO
- Example of passing only the body for updating. The customer ID is included in the body instead of being a parameter in the URL.
